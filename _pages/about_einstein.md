Hi, I'm William! I'm currently studying computer science at Carnegie Mellon University where I'm broadly interested in backend software development and machine learning systems. I'm also a teaching assistant for 15-150, Principles of Functional Programming.

Outside of school, I enjoy working out, tennis, and video games. I used to be heavily involved in speech and debate, and now serve as an assistant coach for my high school team.

Feel free to reach me at [williamchien@cmu.edu](mailto:williamchien@cmu.edu).
